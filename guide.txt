What's Been Implemented:

The platform includes secure user registration and authentication, complete voter profile management with document uploads, and a full election browsing system. Voters can participate through a sophisticated voting interface that captures facial photos for verification, while unique time-limited voting links (expiring after 2 minutes) ensure security. The system tracks location data during voting and maintains comprehensive audit trails of all activities.

Users can monitor their vote status in real-time, receive notifications about election updates, and access an integrated user guide. The platform features a feedback system for voters to share their experience, and all data is protected through row-level security policies ensuring voters can only access their own information.

Key Security Features:

Facial recognition verification during voting matches against registered profile photos
Time-limited voting links with 2-minute expiration windows
Location tracking for fraud prevention while maintaining voter anonymity
Encrypted vote hashing to protect ballot secrecy
Comprehensive audit logging of all system interactions
Secure document and photo storage with access controls
How It Works:

Users create accounts and complete detailed profiles with verification documents. After administrator approval, they can browse active elections and request voting access. The system generates secure links, performs facial verification, and allows candidate selection with confirmation steps. All votes are recorded anonymously with security measures in place, and voters receive real-time tracking of their participation.

The platform is fully responsive, works across all devices, and follows modern security best practices for handling sensitive voting data.
